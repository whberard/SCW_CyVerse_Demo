This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


The first thing I'm doing here is reading in the data, and choosing only the data I want: 

```{r}
# install.packages("dplyr", dependencies = TRUE) # only do this once!
library("dplyr")

gap.in <- read.csv("http://naupaka.net/files/gapminder.csv")
gap.in %>%
  filter(country %in% c("Czech Republic", "Greece", "Portugal")) -> vacay.data
vacay.data
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
